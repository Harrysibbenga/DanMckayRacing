Learning about cars at the family workshop and service station in Auckland, New Zealand, Bruce travelled to the United Kingdom in 1958 to continue his racing development.</p>

In Formula 1 it has won 182 Grands Prix and 12 Drivers’ and eight Constructers’ Championships. It has also won three times at the Indianapolis 500, secured one win at the Le Mans 24 Hours, and won a remarkable 43 races and five consecutive Constructors’ Championship titles in Can-Am.</p>
